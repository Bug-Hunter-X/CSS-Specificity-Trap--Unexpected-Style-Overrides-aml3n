The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors:

```css
.container {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

#my-element {
  background-color: lightcoral;
}

.container #my-element {
  background-color: lightgreen; /* This style is never applied due to specificity */
}

```

The intended behavior is to make the element with the id "my-element" which is inside the element with the class "container" have a lightgreen background.  However, due to the way CSS specificity works, the more specific selector `#my-element` overrides the less specific selector `.container #my-element`.

This example highlights that specificity sometimes behaves in counter-intuitive ways that are easy to overlook.
